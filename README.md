# gosafely-webapp

## Overview

For my 3rd project, and first full-stack web app, I created a web app for a local tech safety company, GoSafely. The user interacts with the app by entering their information into the input field and submitting it, thus saving their information to the database.

## Technologies Used

* **Stack** - Mongo (Mongoose), Express (Body-Parser), React (Axios, React-Router-Dom, Styled-Components), Node.js (Nodemon, Concurrently)

* **Languages Used** - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
